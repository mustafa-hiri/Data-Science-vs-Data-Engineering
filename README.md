# Data-Science-vs-Data-Engineering
Data Science vs Data Engineering:

---> Understanding and leveraging both data science and data engineering can help businesses make data-driven decisions, improve efficiency, and ultimately enhance their operations and profitability.

I will break it down in a way that's easy to understand:

1) Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that uses a range of techniques to extract meaningful insights and information from data. It combines statistical and computational principles to analyze and interpret complex datasets. In simpler terms, data science is about discovering hidden patterns from raw data.

For example, let's say your boss runs a chain of clothing stores. A data scientist can use the past data from all the transactions in the stores to predict which clothes will be more popular in the future, or they can identify trends in sales to determine which times of the year are busiest and need more staff. They can also segment customers into different groups based on their buying patterns and tailor marketing campaigns for these specific groups, leading to more effective marketing and increased sales.

2) On the other hand, Data Engineering is a field that focuses on the practical applications of data collection and analysis. While data science is focused on analyzing and interpreting complex datasets, data engineering is about building and maintaining the systems and infrastructure that allow this analysis to happen. It involves designing, building, and managing large-scale data processing systems, databases, and data pipelines.

Continuing with our clothing store example, a data engineer's job would be to ensure that all the transaction data from all the different stores is collected reliably and stored securely in a database. They would also build the pipelines (processes) that move and transform this data, making it ready for a data scientist to analyze.

In a nutshell:

- Data Scientists focus on creating models that help make sense of complex data, they work more on the interpretation and analysis side.

- Data Engineers, on the other hand, focus on building robust, efficient, and reliable systems to handle, store and process large amounts of data, they work more on the infrastructure side.



## An example of how the dataset might look for our case above:
TransactionID: A unique identifier for each transaction

StoreID: The unique identifier of the store where the transaction took place

CustomerID: The unique identifier for each customer

Date: The date when the transaction took place

ItemID: The unique identifier for each item sold

ItemCategory: The category of the item (e.g., Men's Clothing, Women's Clothing, Kid's Clothing)

ItemSubCategory: The sub-category of the item (e.g., Shirts, Pants, Skirts)

Quantity: The number of the same item bought in the transaction

Price: The price of the item

Total: The total cost of the transaction


| TransactionID | StoreID | CustomerID | Date       | ItemID | ItemCategory | ItemSubCategory | Quantity | Price | Total |
|---------------|---------|------------|------------|--------|--------------|-----------------|----------|-------|-------|
| 001           | 01      | 1001       | 2023-06-01 | A001   | Men's Clothing   | Shirts          | 2        | 50    | 100   |
| 002           | 01      | 1002       | 2023-06-01 | B001   | Women's Clothing | Skirts          | 1        | 60    | 60    |
| 003           | 02      | 1003       | 2023-06-01 | C001   | Kid's Clothing   | Pants           | 3        | 30    | 90    |
| 004           | 02      | 1001       | 2023-06-02 | A001   | Men's Clothing   | Shirts          | 1        | 50    | 50    |
| 005           | 03      | 1004       | 2023-06-02 | B001   | Women's Clothing | Skirts          | 2        | 60    | 120   |

In this hypothetical dataset:

- Transaction 001 represents a customer with ID 1001 buying 2 shirts from the men's clothing category at Store 01 on June 1st, 2023. Each shirt costs 50, so the total for this transaction is 100.
- Transaction 002 represents a different customer (ID 1002) buying a skirt from the women's clothing category at the same store (Store 01) on the same day. The skirt costs 60, so the total for this transaction is 60.
- And so on for the other transactions.

This is just a small slice of the data. In reality, you would likely have many more transactions, and potentially more fields depending on what information is relevant for your analysis.

#### The Target and the Features
In a dataset, the target (or label) is the variable that we want to predict or forecast, while the features (or predictors) are the variables that we use to make that prediction. 

The choice of target and features depends on the specific question or problem that you're trying to solve with your data science project.

Let's consider some examples using the hypothetical clothing store dataset:

1. **Predicting future sales**: In this case, your target variable might be the 'Total' column, because that's what you're trying to predict. The features could be 'Date', 'StoreID', 'ItemID', 'ItemCategory', 'ItemSubCategory', and 'Price', because these are the variables that you would expect to influence sales.

2. **Customer segmentation**: Here, you might not have a specific target variable because customer segmentation is usually an unsupervised learning task (i.e., there's no specific outcome you're predicting). Instead, you would use features like 'CustomerID', 'ItemID', 'ItemCategory', 'ItemSubCategory', and 'Total' to identify groups of similar customers.

3. **Predicting popular products**: If you wanted to predict which items will be most popular in the future, your target could be 'ItemID' or 'ItemSubCategory'. The features might include 'Date', 'StoreID', 'Price', and 'Total'.

In general, choosing the right target and features is an important part of the data science process, and it requires both a good understanding of the business problem and the data you have available.
